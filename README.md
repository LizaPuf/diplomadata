# Visualization of my diploma data

During my undergraduate studies, I studied platelet P2 receptors. Activation of the receptors led to the activation of platelets and the onset of thrombus formation.
Vitamin B derivatives suppressed platelet activation function. Thus, these compounds may become a cure for thrombosis in the future.

With the help of Python and the library Matplotlib, I drew a graph of the degree of platelet activation depending on the addition of compounds to platelet-rich plasma

Here's what came out of it
